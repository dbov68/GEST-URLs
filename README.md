target: manage url's with tags and description
How:
I try to do it with Python 3.8 as local application

Concept:
This application must work on all devices that support Python and SQLite like:
IOS, Android, Windown, Linux

Data will be save locally on a SQlite database

Future:
I will make a central repository and replicate/sync between other devices
